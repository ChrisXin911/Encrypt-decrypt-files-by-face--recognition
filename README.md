# Encrypt-decrypt-files-by-face--recognition
- This is the project code for DeltaHackathon in Mcmaster University.
- We completed the code with python.
- I just studied the Python that day.Installing the development environment for Python on Windows is a little tricky. My teammate Andrew finished the encrypt/decrpt part, I completed the face recognition and intergrated them.
- It was a special experience in McMaster University, thanks my teammates Andrew, Tony, Omer.
